# Version 4 Highlights and Goals

## Enhanced Functionality

Version 3 was instrumental for deploying the Falcon sensor, but the scope was limited. Version 4, on the other hand, comes with extended functionalities that are more aligned with our current and future objectives. These enhancements will allow us to tap into a broader range of CrowdStrike's capabilities, such as threat hunting and real-time reporting.

## Improved Automation Workflows

The new version provides more granular control over automation workflows. This is crucial as we continue to expand our automation deployments across different platforms and environments. The richer set of modules in version 4 will allow us to customize and fine-tune our automation strategies more effectively.

## Extending SDK's Reach via Modules

One of the significant benefits of Ansible is its flexibility in extending an SDK's reach through the use of modules. Version 4 of the CrowdStrike Ansible Collection embodies this by offering a more comprehensive set of modules that can integrate seamlessly with our existing solutions, thus providing a more cohesive and robust cybersecurity posture.

## Streamlined Operations

The upgrade to version 4 will facilitate a more streamlined and efficient operation process. The new features and functionalities make it easier to manage configurations, enforce policies, and orchestrate complex tasks, which will, in turn, reduce the operational overhead and increase our focus on strategic activities.

## Future-Proofing

By moving to version 4, we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of future updates and enhancements more easily, ensuring that we remain at the forefront of cybersecurity automation technology.

We encourage everyone to review the documentation for the new version and familiarize yourselves with its features.
