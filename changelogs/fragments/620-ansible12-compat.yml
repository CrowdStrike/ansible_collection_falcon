bugfixes:
  - "falcon_install role - Fixed conditional evaluation compatibility with ansible-core >=2.19 (Ansible 12) by converting string-based conditionals to explicit boolean comparisons across api.yml, preinstall.yml, url.yml, and win_url.yml (https://github.com/CrowdStrike/ansible_collection_falcon/issues/620). Fixed direct variable evaluations in cleanup.yml and auth.yml. Fixed validation conditionals in preinstall.yml to use explicit string length checks. Fixed boolean variables falcon_gpg_key_check and falcon_localfile_cleanup in install.yml to use proper boolean conversion."
  - "falcon_configure role - Fixed conditional evaluation compatibility with ansible-core >=2.19 (Ansible 12) by converting AND conditionals with potentially undefined variables to explicit boolean comparisons across main.yml, configure.yml, and win_configure.yml. Also fixed register result usage in conditionals where falconctl_info.cid could be null. Fixed until clause in AID generation retry loop to handle null values properly. Fixed boolean variable falcon_remove_aid to use proper boolean conversion instead of length checks."
  - "falcon_uninstall role - Fixed conditional evaluation compatibility with ansible-core >=2.19 (Ansible 12) by converting AND conditionals with potentially undefined variables to explicit boolean comparisons in main.yml. Fixed assert statements in remove_host_pretasks.yml to handle null AID values from register operations. Fixed register result usage in win_uninstall.yml where file search results could be null."
