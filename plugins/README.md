# CrowdStrike Falcon Plugins

This directory contains the [module_utils](./module_utils/), [modules](./modules/), and [inventory](./inventory/) directories which provide the necessary code to interact with the CrowdStrike Falcon API. Plugins are pieces of code that augment Ansible's core functionality.
