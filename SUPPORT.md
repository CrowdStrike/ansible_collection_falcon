# CrowdStrike Ansible Collection Support

## Red Hat Ansible Certified Content Support

As Red Hat Ansible Certified Content, this collection is entitled to support through the Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) using the **Create issue** button on the top right corner. If a support case cannot be opened with Red Hat and the collection has been obtained either from Galaxy or GitHub, there may be community help available on the [Ansible Forum](https://forum.ansible.com/).

## Community Support

CrowdStrike Ansible Collection is a community-driven, open source project aimed at simplifying the integration and utilization of CrowdStrike's Falcon platform with Ansible automation. While not an official CrowdStrike product, the CrowdStrike Ansible Collection is maintained by CrowdStrike and supported in collaboration with the open source developer community.

## Issue Reporting and Questions

Issues related to the CrowdStrike Ansible Collection can be reported on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/ansible_collection_falcon/issues/new/choose). These issues are utilized to track bugs, documentation updates, enhancement requests, and security concerns.

## Support Escalation

Our primary objective is to provide support for utilizing the CrowdStrike Ansible Collection within the repository itself. This approach helps to expand our online knowledge base, empowers the community with self-help resources, and potentially reduces the resolution time for queries.

If you are a CrowdStrike customer and prefer to address your questions or issues directly with the CrowdStrike Support team, you are encouraged to [reach out to the CrowdStrike technical support team](https://supportportal.crowdstrike.com/).
